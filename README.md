# UnivariateBivariate-Analysis-on-Flask
Created a Dashboard using Flask to show a univariate and Bivariate Analysis

## Airbnb Dataset Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for the famous Airbnb dataset from Kaggle. The dataset was carefully selected and underwent thorough data cleaning to ensure accuracy. Following the cleaning process, preprocessing techniques were applied to prepare the data for analysis.

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase was then conducted to gain insights into the dataset. Various statistical techniques and visualizations were employed to understand the relationships between different variables and uncover patterns within the data.

To provide a user-friendly interface for exploring the analysis results, a dashboard was created using Flask, a Python web framework. This interactive dashboard allows users to view both univariate and bivariate analyses, enabling them to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset and its characteristics.

## Contents

- `data/`: This directory contains the Airbnb dataset files used for the analysis.
- `code/`: This directory contains the Python code for data cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA.
- `dashboard/`: This directory contains the Flask application code for the interactive dashboard.
